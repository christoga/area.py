# Area
This script came when I'm learning logical algorithm, That is the reason why I create this python script😋

This python script is useful for counting the area of a shape😏

## Shape
For now, triangle is the only available shape,
Gonna add some more (tomorrow)😁

## To Use
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/codingsmartschool/area.py
$ cd area.py
$ python main.py
```
